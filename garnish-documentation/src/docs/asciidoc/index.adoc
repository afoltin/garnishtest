==  What is Garnish and how it is organised
Garnish is a collection of steps, mockservers, db tools and other functionality that are commonly used in BDD projects.
This collection is split into 5 different deliverables:

* Garnish steps db
* Garnish steps mockhttpserver
* Garnish steps restclient
* Garnish steps selenium
* Garnish steps vars

=== Garnish steps db
This deliverable contains a step library with which a db can be brought into a desired state, as well as steps with which the
state of the db can be verified after running a step in a scenario. See <<Database state matching>> for more info.

=== Garnish steps mockhttpserver
Often it is desirable to mock the behaviour of third party systems when integration testing instead of calling those 3rd party systems.
This deliverable contains steps to mock the request/response interaction, using wiremock.

=== Garnish steps restclient
This deliverable contains steps typically used when integration testing a rest library. Eg for doing a post to an endpoint with a JSON payload and specific headers.

=== Garnish steps selenium
TODO

=== Garnish steps vars
Often in a scenario the result of one step has to be used in a following step. To facilitate this, Garnish offers scenario variable functionality.
See <<Scenario variables>>.

== Getting started
The best way to get started is looking at the demo project in this git repository under garnish-demo/garnish-demo-rest.
There you will find two subprojects, garnish-demo-rest-web and garnish-demo-rest-test. The first is an example project and the
second one the test project for the first one.

=== Example web project
TODO explain what the project is about.

=== Testing the example project
This project contains a pom.xml which can be used as a starting point when creating your own test project.
You can run your test project as described in <<Running all the tests from command line>>


== Features
This section documents some features of the integration test framework which are not immediately obvious.

=== Comments in JSON files
Even if this is not strictly valid JSON, both the `actual.http.json` and `expected.http.json` JSON files allow comments.
Both line and block comments are supported (in C/Java/JavaScript style):

* `//`  to start a line comment
* `/\*` to start and `*/` to end a block comment

This allows us to document the data in those files, making the integration tests easier to understand,
and also easier to fix when they fail.


=== Scenario variables
Sometimes you need to do an HTTP call that includes data from a previous step, and this data is dynamic.

Take for example a paswordless login feature.
In this case, you make an API call that will email a one-time PIN and then using the PIN from the email you make a second call
to obtain an authorization authToken.
In this case, the integration test needs to make the first call, read the PIN from the email, save it to a variable,
and use this variable in the request body of the second call.

For this reason, the framework supports "scenario variables" that can be set in one step and then used in another.
Scenario variables are cleared after each scenario.

The syntax by which you tell the framework that you need the value of a scenario variable is `${variableName}`.
These variables can be referred to by that syntax from:

* initial and expected *.http.json HTTP request/response files
* initial and expected *.db.xml database state files


=== @Functions

==== Introduction and examples
Using expected *.http.json and *.db.xml files is very easy to check that the HTTP response fields or database columns
have a particular value.

In some cases though, a less-than-exact matching would be more appropriate. For example, we might want to check
that the database contains a generated authorization authToken (the column is not empty), but we don't care much about
the actual value. Or maybe we want to check that a particular API returns a customer ID, without caring about its value.

For these cases, @functions can be used. Instead of an exact value, the expected file can contain an @function like this:

[source,javascript]
.create-group-expected.http.json
----
{
  "customerId" : "@isNotEmpty()",
  "groupId"    : "@isNotEmpty()",
  "name"       : "Group no admin",
}
----

In this example, the `name` field is matched exactly, while the fields `customerId` and `groupId` should have at least
one character.

The @functions can also have parameters:
[source,xml]
.login-expected.db.xml
----
<BLC_TOKEN CUSTOMER_ID='1' TOKEN_KEY='@matchesRegex("[-a-z0-9]+")' />
----

==== Syntax
Note that @functions follow Java syntax. In particular, string literals must be enclosed in double quotes.
This is why we used single quotes for the attribute values in the XML above.

==== Supported @functions

Currently, the following @functions are supported:

* `@isNull()`
* `@isNotNull()`
* `@isEmpty()`, if the the expected value should be null or the empty string
* `@isNotEmpty()`, if the expected value should have at least one character
* `@isBlank()`, if the expected value should be null or contain only whitespace characters
* `@isNotBlank()`, if the expected value should contain at least one non-whitespace character
* `@matchesRegex(String regex)`, if the expected value should match the given regular expression. For information about
  the format of the regular expression, see the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[javadoc of the java.util.Pattern class].

==== Custom @functions

Besides the above, the framework allows registering custom @functions.
To see how this can be done, please check the source code.

==== Matching a text that begins with `@`
In case you want setup an exact match for a text that starts "@", you can escape it with a backslash:
[source,javascript]
.create-group-expected.http.json
----
{
  "location" : "\\@home",
}
----
The above will match a `location` field with the exact value `@home` (the backslash is ignored).
Note that we uses a double backslash in the example above, because the backslash character itself needs to be escaped
in JSON strings.

Escaping @functions using the backslash also works in database state expected files (expected *.db.xml).


=== JSON matching
Matching an HTTP response with a *.http.json file is done partially: only the fields present in the expected file
will be matched against the HTTP response. Fields that are not in the expected file can have any value or even be absent
from the HTTP response.


=== Database state matching

==== Format of the XML file
The expected database state XML file (expected *.db.xml) will be matched against the database as follows:

* XML _elements_ in the expected *.db.xml correspond to _tables_ in the database
* XML _attributes_ in the expected *.db.xml file correspond to _columns_ in the database

Example:
[source,xml]
.group-create-expected.db.xml
----
<MO_GROUP NAME="Group no admin" TYPE="OPEN_GROUP" />
----

In this case, the table `MO_GROUP` should have at least one row that has the column `NAME` equal to "`Group no admin`"
and `TYPE` equal to "`OPEN_GROUP`".

==== XSD generation
To aid in editing *.db.xml files, an XSD is generated from the database. This provides auto-completion and error checking
in the IDE, greatly reducing typos in table or column names.


==== Partial matching
Similar to JSON matching, database state matching is also done partially:

* ignore tables for which there are no elements in the expected *.db.xml file
* only the rows in the expected *.db.xml file will be matched against the database. The tables in the database can
  have extra rows which will be ignored.
* only the attributes in the expected *.db.xml file will be matched against the database. The other columns in the
  database will be ignored (they can have any value).

==== Placeholders
Many times we want to check that the value of a column in one table is the same as the value of another column
in another table, without caring for the exact value.

Example:
[source,xml]
.group-create-expected.db.xml
----
<MO_GROUP ID="%{groupId}" NAME="Friends" />

<MO_GROUPMEMBER GROUP_ID="%{groupId}" CUSTOMER_ID="1" STATE="ACTIVE" />
----

In this case we want to check that the column `GROUP_ID` from the table `MO_GROUPMEMBER` has the same value as the
column `ID` from the table `MO_GROUP`. We don't care about what the actual value is as long as they are equal.

More accurately, the example above expects that:

* the database contains at least one row in the table `MO_GROUP` that has `NAME="Friends"`
* the database contains at least one row in the table `MO_GROUPMEMBER` that has `CUSTOMER_ID="1"` and `STATE="ACTIVE"`
* the row in the `MO_GROUPMEMBER` table has the same value for `GROUP_ID` as the row in the `MO_GROUP` table has for `ID`

These wildcard variables are called `placeholders`.

As seen from the example above, the syntax for placeholders is `%{placeholderName}`.


== What maven does
. reserve free network ports for the embedded servlet container, the HTTP mock server, and the mock email server
. deploy solr and rest-api webapps in an embedded servlet container, passing the ports above, so that rest-api connects to mock servers
. run the integration tests
    .. the port on which the servlet container is running, is passed to the tests as a system variable: "test.restApi.port"
    .. the test runs
        ... starts the mock HTTP server (to mock mule)
        ... start the mock email server (to verify emails)
        ... connect through HTTP to rest-api and call endpoints
        ... make verifications (email, rest-api HTTP responses, etc.)
        ... as the tests runs, Cucumber will record what has been running, success or not, etc.
. stops the servlet container
. finish creating reports at `"integration-test/target/cucumber/cucumber-html-report"`, using data recorded during tests (report aggregation)
. if there were test failures, fail the build

Here is how it all works together:

== Using Java 8

Because the HTTP mock server that we use (WireMock) requires Java 8, running the tests (whether from maven command line
or from the IDE) should be done using that version.

Attempting to run using Java 7 will result in a confusing error:
....
NoSuchMethodError: java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.keySet()Ljava/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap$KeySetView
....


== Running all the tests from command line
Just run the following command:

Suppose that your integration tests live in a subdirectory called integration-test under your current directory:
....
mvn clean verify -am -pl integration-test -DrunIntegrationTests
....

The Cucumber reports can be found at `integration-test/target/cucumber/cucumber-html-report`.

See also the shell scripts at `garnish-demo/garnish-demo-rest-test/shell-scripts/<OS>`.



== Setup IntelliJ

=== Starting your rest-api webapp

==== Run
All the stories expect your rest-api to be running (normally they are started by maven before running the tests).
Before running an individual test from IntelliJ, you need to your rest-api from command line, assuming your test project is called integration-test:
....
mvn verify -am -pl integration-test -DrunIntegrationTests -DpauseBeforeTests
....

The `pauseBeforeTests` system variable will cause Maven to stop just before running the tests. This is useful because
now your rest-api is started and is accepting requests.

==== Debug + code reload using JDK's HotSwap
If you want to be able to change rest-api java code and re-load the changes using Hotswap, just start maven in debug mode:
....
mvnDebug verify -am -pl integration-test -DrunIntegrationTests -DpauseBeforeTests
....

This starts maven in debug mode on port 8000. To connect to it, create a "Remote debug" run configuration in IntelliJ,
and start it.
Then, once rest-api is deployed, just change the rest-api code when needed, and right click the class and choose
"Compile" (Ctrl+Shift+F9) or "Make" (Ctrl+F9). Make sure you have Hotswap activated in the debugger settings of IntelliJ.
You can also put breakpoints and debug as usual.
Note that, because of Hotswap limitations, you can only change method bodies. You are not allowed to change method
signatures, add methods, create classes, change inheritance hierarchy, etc. If you need to do that, you need to re-start maven.

==== Debug + code reload using JRebel
If you want to use JRebel instead of Java's Hotswap, before using the ``mvnDebug`` command above, setup your
`MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable to point to it, for example:
....
MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=384m -noverify -javaagent:d:/Programs/Development/JRebel/jrebel.jar
....

==== Debug + code reload using HotSwap Agent
If you want to use https://github.com/HotswapProjects/HotswapAgent[HotSwap Agent] (free alternative to JRebel) instead
of Java's Hotswap, before using the `mvnDebug` command above, setup your `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable to point
to it, for example:
....
MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=384m -XXaltjvm=dcevm -javaagent:d:/Programs/Development/HotSwapAgent/hotswap-agent.jar
....


=== Executing tests
Once your rest-api iss up and running, you can start executing tests from IntelliJ.

To do this, create a JUnit run configuration with the following parameters:

* class name: `your.standard.package.structure.integrationtest.RestApiTestSuite`
* working directory: `{full path to integration-test module}`
* VM options:
    ** ports (required; they usually have the value given in this example, unless that port is already used on your local machine):
        *** `-Dtest.restApi.port=2000` to pass the port on which rest-api was deployed by maven
    ** `-DstoryNamePattern=**/MyLittle.feature` if you want to run only the ``MyLittle`` feature (optional);
      ant-like patterns are available
    ** if you want to pass all HTTP requests done in the test through an HTTP proxy (like Fiddler or Charles), add the
      following system variables (optional):
        *** `-Dhttp.proxyHost=127.0.0.1`
        *** `-Dhttp.proxyPort=8888`
        *** `-Dhttps.proxyHost=127.0.0.1`
        *** `-Dhttps.proxyPort=8888`
        *** `-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=~localhost`

Example:
....
-Dtest.restApi.port=2000
-Dtest.mule.mockServer.port=2001
-Dhttp.proxyHost=127.0.0.1
-Dhttp.proxyPort=8888
-Dhttps.proxyHost=127.0.0.1
-Dhttps.proxyPort=8888
-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=
-DstoryNamePattern=**/GroupLogin.feature
....


=== Seeing the reports
When executing Cucumber feature files, IntelliJ gives a pretty good overview of all features: it shows in an hierarchical form the features, each scenario of a feature,
and each step of a scenario. This is usually enough. From a step one can jump right into the correct location in a feature file.

Because aggregating the cucumber reports is done with a maven plugin after the tests are executed, you won't be able
to see the reports for tests executed in IntelliJ. This is because of the fact that step 5 in the section "What maven does" is never
executed.


== Creating integration tests (features)
The tests are written in given-when-then form, and they are executable Cucumber tests.
These are human readable sentences

The tests can be found at `integration-test/src/test/resources/features/{capability}/{functionality}`.
The `{capability}` and `{functionality}` are used to group stories in a hierarchy: a capability is a big component
of the system (like "sidekick"), and contains one or more functionalities. A functionality contains one or more stories.

IntelliJ has really nice support for Cucumber feature files.
To get it, install the plugin named "Cucumber for Java".

The plugin give you the following really useful features:
* syntax highlighting (including error highlighting for steps that don't exists)
* code completion for steps
* navigation from the step into the feature file and from there to the Java code that implements that step


== When to use "given", "when, and "then"
TODO update

Cucumber steps can be declared as "Given", "When", or "Then".
The guidelines for choosing one of them is:

* if it's not part of the test, but rather a *precondition* (e.g. being logged in, or having the DB in a particular state),
  then use "Given".
* the *action* that is tested (e.g. invoking the endpoint that you want to test), should be executed with "When"
* the *checks/asserts* should be executed with "Then"

The form is:
....
Given that some preconditions are met
When I do an action
Then the result of the action should be X
....

== Further documentation

Cucumber
    https://cucumber.io/

For long stories, set the maximum execution time with this parameter:
    `-Dstory.timeout.in.secs=<number seconds>` (i.e. `-Dstory.timeout.in.secs=3000`).
It is however preferable to split up stories into multiple smaller stories if possible.
